The STM32 obtains the temperature and humidity data and the internal temperature of the chip, and uploads the data to the OneNet platform through MQTT protocol. The platform obtains the data and sends it to the wechat mini program for display. At the same time, the wechat mini program sends JSON packets to the STM32 by calling the platform API interface to realize the control of lighting
